# crowd-analysis-from-istanbul-city-surveillance-cameras

An interface has been designed where you can easily perform crowd analysis by connecting to Istanbul's city surveillance cameras. It was a very enjoyable job for me. This work can be transformed into different projects.

### How to work

you need to run like `python main.py`

it's that easy to operate .enjoy it. Be careful, it can be addictive, you can watch it for hours. :)

## You can see how the program works in the gif below.
